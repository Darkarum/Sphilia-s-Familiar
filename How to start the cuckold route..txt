How to start the cuckold route.

<1>
You can't enter this rout on the first play through. Please clear the Demon lord ending.
Once you clear the demon lord ending, you can use the debug mode which will make things easier.
If you fail to save Sphilia in her rescue event in Laoda on your first playthrough,
please keep the save file.
If you have the save file, you can go back and clear the event.


<2>
If you cleared the game at least once, you can use debug mode from any save file.
Start with the save file right after you failed the rescue event in Laoda stated in <1>
and talk to the woman in the inn, and follow directions.

*After the demon lord ending, if you wish to start the game from the beginning please follow the procedure here.
(1) After the opening and you're able to free roam, make Sphilia your ally.
(2) In debug mode, add "Max out set."(The set will release full money, skills, gear, level, and runes)
(3) Go to Laoda immediately and go through the events there.
During this if you go to any place before Laoda in debug mode, the game will be bugged.
(This is because you haven't played the game going through the trigger events)

Once the cuckolding starts for real, you will be guided to events in other areas.
After this happens you can go to other locations outside Laoda.
(For versions v2.01 and later, once the cuckolding starts
the game has been programmed to recognize you completed the game up to Laoda.
For example the volcano event has been changed to cleared.)
